*   PROGRAM NAME:
*       Assignment3 - Deck of Cards
*
*   Description:
*	Card:  A class like the one presented in the modules, but with a few
*       changes.
*       Hand:  A class that represents the cards held by a single player.
*       Deck:  A class that represents the source of the cards for dealing and, 
*       as the game progresses, the place from which players can receive new 
*       cards (say, as they pick cards "from the deck" or when future hands 
*       are to be dealt from the same deck).  Recall this picture, which 
*       relates the Deck to the various Hands that it creates through the 
*       process called "dealing".
*       
*       Notice that the char 'T' to describe the value 10. The Joker is ignored
*       as it is not need at this time.
*       
*       The dealer uses a Deck object to deal Hand objects to the players.  
*       The dealer may or may not be a player who gets a hand of his own 
*       (poker dealers in casinos don't receive a hand, but most other games 
*       involve the dealer getting a hand).
*       
*       Card: The Card class has two obvious members:  value (a char)  and suit 
*       (an enum).  But we add a new boolean, errorFlag, which can inform a 
*       client that a card is in an illegal state. We'll want the usual 
*       constructors, mutators, accessors and toString() methods for the class. 
*       We only allow standard cards, like ('A', clubs), ('9', hearts) and ('T',
*       diamonds), no jokers or other special cards.
*       
*       Hand:  As you can see, a Hand object usually contains several cards, so
*       we'll need an array of Card objects (myArray) as the principal member 
*       of the Hand class.  Since each game deals a different number of cards 
*       into its players hands, and even within a game the number of cards in a 
*       hand will increase or decrease, we must keep track of this with an int 
*       value (numCards).  We'll need constructors, mutators, etc., of course.  
*       We'll also want a way for the hand to receive a card (from the deck or 
*       somewhere else), and play a card (to the table or to another player).  
*       These two methods will be called takeCard() and playCard(), 
*       respectively.  Since this class has no information about the game being 
*       played, it always puts new cards received by takeCard() into the next 
*       available location of the array (index position numCards) and plays a 
*       card via playCard() from the highest occupied location (index position 
*       numCards - 1).  The client game application would somehow prepare this 
*       highest position with the correct card to be played before calling 
*       Hand's playCard() method.  This detail is not our concern.
*       
*       Deck: A Deck object is the source of all cards.  It's where the dealer 
*       gets cards to deal, and if a player takes an individual card after the 
*       deal, he takes it from the Deck object.  Naturally, the primary member 
*       here is an array of Card objects, much like Hand.  We'll call this 
*       member cards[].  A deck normally consists of a single pack of cards: 
*       52 cards (four suits of 13 values each).  However, some games use two, 
*       three or more packs.  If a card game requires two packs, then the deck 
*       will consist of two full 52-card packs:  104 cards.  (Many games throw 
*       away some cards before beginning.  For example Pinochle wants all cards 
*       with values 8-and-below to be taken out of the deck, but we will not 
*       trouble ourselves with this complexity.)  A newly instantiated deck 
*       will have a multiple of 52 cards and will contain all the standard 
*       cards, so the number of cards in a newly instantiated deck will be 52, 
*       104, 156, ...,  i.e., numPacks Ã— 52.
